# Case Study: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attack

This case study demonstrates a real-world Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, its technical breakdown, impact on business operations, and recommended countermeasures.

---

##  Scenario:
In March 2023, a major e-commerce platform experienced downtime due to a massive traffic surge. Upon investigation, it was found that the traffic was generated by a botnet spread across thousands of IPs, targeting their main product listing API endpoint.

### Timeline of Events:
1. Unusual traffic detected on the product API at 10:03 AM.
2. Within 10 minutes, server response times dropped to critical levels.
3. Auto-scaling triggered multiple times, but could not mitigate traffic volume.
4. SOC team identified traffic sources using geolocation and header analysis.
5. Mitigation applied via Cloudflare and upstream provider filtering at 12:58 PM.

##  Attack Vector:
- Type: Volume-based DDoS (UDP Flood)
- Tool Used: Mirai Botnet
- Duration: 3 hours of full service denial

### Tools Used by Attackers:
- **Botnet Name:** Mirai variant
- **Protocol Used:** UDP
- **Target Port:** 80 / 443 (API endpoints)
- **Traffic Pattern:** Randomized payloads, no clear identifiable headers

---

##  Impact:
- Loss of revenue (~$100,000 estimated)
- Brand damage
- Increased server cost (auto-scaling triggered)

---

##  Mitigation:
- Rate limiting API endpoints
- DDoS protection services (Cloudflare, Akamai, etc.)
- Monitoring sudden traffic spikes
